                Kitty the Hat Makin’ Cat, is an interactive simulation game that I coded in
                Java using Eclipse as an IDE, it follows a cat named Kitty through her day in the neighborhood.
                <br><br>
                As the final project for a multimedia programming course, the aim of this application was to create 
                an interactive simulation which would lead a user through some process to produce an end result. 
                I decided on an activity that involved a playful plot to propel the game.

                The story begins outside Kitty’s house where there is an option to customize her avatar, she walks through the 
                neighborhood and meets her fellow hat-loving friend, Darcy. 
                This initiates dialogue between the two cats where Darcy asks Kitty to 
                help her collect some items to create a new sunhat for her collection. 
                Kitty continues her wak and collects items for Darcy along the way. 
                By the end of the process she has gathered enough items to decorate Darcy’s 
                hat with, the user can choose two items which generate the final product according to what has been selected.

                        For the background and environment, I wanted an area

                        an asset pack from an artist named

                        This application was coded in Java using the 
                        Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE), 
                        along with the help of both Minim and Processing Java libraries.
                        I outlined my initial plan for the project in a 
                        <a href="../pdf/kittyGDD.pdf" target="_blank">game design document</a>
                        that was drafted before I began coding. <br>
                        PVector is the main class utilized from the Processing library within my 
                        project, as it is efficient in storing the x and y values 
                        of variables together such as for velocity or position. 
                        Another helpful library used is Minim which is a Java sound library that 
                        aids in making the process of playing, looping, or pausing audio very seamless.

                    <h3 class="sectionHeader ">Code Snippets</h3>
                    <p class="projInfoStyle">
                        For Kitty's avatar, I sliced the sprite sheet containing her walking 
                        animation within the code through creating an additional SpriteSheet class containing the methods to do so. 
                        An issue I faced as was integrating the option to customize Kitty’s avatar during the animation. 
                        I wanted to include the option for her to wear different fun hats as a playful feature, although 
                        layering the hats over each frame was a challenging task. To resolve this, I used a decorator 
                        pattern to add accessories over the base sprite sheet 
                        used for Kitty’s walk. This structural pattern allowed me to add each hat on 
                        top of Kitty’s base avatar through extending from the KittyDecorator class and 
                        overriding its drawKitty() method to include the separate hats.

                        For the background I felt that a parallax effect would 
                        fit the atmosphere I wanted for the game and create a unique environment. 
                        I did this through making a class that controlled the 
                        direction of movement displayed by the background layers. These layers 
                        would move depending on whether the user clicked the right or left key on their keyboard.

                        In order to transition between different screens depending on user 
                        interaction and button clicks, I utilized a Finite State Machine (FSM) 
                        model. I declared each screen as its own string and used a state variable 
                        which changed depending on a conditional which checked the button that would be 
                        clicked on a specific screen. This would trigger specific audio or visuals to play.

                        As a part of this project, I was tasked with the

                        to visually enhance an aspect of the game. I used 
                        recursion to create a heart that is shown over Darcy’s 
                        head during positive dialogue sequences. Whereas during 
                        negative sequences an unhappy face appears, featuring a 
                        dynamic cloudy affect that utilizes Perlin noise

                        For the collection portion of my game I stored each visible item in a 
                        HashMap, that would disappear when clicked on and display the corresponding 
                        storage box in the top left corner once collected.
                        Once the user has collected at least two items, they are able 
                        click on Darcy to move onto the hat creation page which will display 
                        the collected materials. From there, the user can choose two items to 
                        decorate a hat with. The selection is stored within an ArrayList that is 
                        accessed in the final hat reveal screen, 
                        which displays a unique hat based on the users choice.

                    interactions outside of the material covered within the course. 
                    I enjoyed the creative freedom this granted me and the experience

                    parallax movement, and creating a unique end result. Some future modifications
                    I'd like to make are more avatar customization options, additional interaction
                    during dialogue sequences, and added challenges in finding items.

                            This pavillion explores spatial design concepts and was a project I worked on alongside my partner, Emily Xu.<br>
                            It is a proposed design for a structure located within Holland Park, 
                            created with the goal of showcasing an art sculpture 
                            <br>
                            The focal point of this project is to explore propagation based 
                            parametric systems, using Rhino and Grasshopper as visual programming environments.

                            A necessary initial step in developing our plans for the pavilion 
                            was to scope out the area, surroundings, and location of Holland park. 
                            We assessed certain structures central to the park and considered how our 
                            pavilion may exist in harmony with these existing compositions.
                            <br><br>
                            These pre-existing structures include flower sculptures throughout the 
                            area which embrace the parks environment, surrounded by trees and nature. 
                            The metal sculptures mirror the natural shapes nearby, acting as a bridge 
                            between the towering city structures and the lush park greenery.

                            Our brainstorming process began by exploring various 
                            natural and organic form such as trees, leaves, and other 
                            plants. We narrowed our scope down to leaves, as the simple 
                            and fluid shape would complement the shape of the flower 
                            petals appearing throughout the park's sculptures.

                            Further design exploration included consideration of the pavilions 
                            location within the park, structure circulation, art sculpture 
                            placement, and materials we would potentially use.

                            We settled on situating the pavilion in a spacious grassy 
                            section close to the park's center. This patch exists near 
                            fountains, a decorated pond of water, and open pathways 
                            which surround it. The pavilion would be 
                            oriented toward the central circular area, 
                            inviting prospective visitors into the heart of the park.

                            We decided upon the design of a wavy pavilion with an organic, 
                            fluid appearance. This design seamlessly integrates with the 
                            surrounding elements of water, greenery, and existing structures, 
                            providing a spacious area for both leisure and art sculpture observation.

                        <p class="projInfoStyle">
                            With the base design finalized, we brainstormed various 
                            lighting iterations to find the ideal fit for our final concept. 
                            This included experimenting with overhead cutouts, layered structures, 
                            and spacing multiple elements. We found that cutouts did not feel cohesive 
                            with our design goals and that layering limited the amount of natural light 
                            within the pavilion. While spacing structures facilitated light entry, it interfered 
                            with our goal for open circulation and accessible entry/exit points.

                        <p class="projInfoStyle">
                            We decided to pivot into the use of materials to address the 
                            concern of designing for ample sunlight and circulation. 
                            We chose two main materials to construct our pavilion with, 
                            glass and metal. The glass not only provides a translucent sheet 
                            of coverage that would allow sunlight to enter and bounce off,  
                            it also aids in representing elements of  water and life within 
                            the park. Additionally, the use of metal symbolizes the nearby 
                            urban architecture surrounding the park and 
                            harmonizes with the flower sculptures made of light grey metal.
                            <br><br>
                            The last phase involved fine-tuning the design with chosen materials 
                            and location in mind. This included expanding the overhead surface 
                            for greater coverage over the art sculpture to protect it from 
                            weather variables such as rain, hail, or snow. We also incorporated 
                            extra curvature into its silhouette and applied a similar approach 
                            to the pavilion's base, achieving a more seamless and unified appearance. 
                            We used 
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkz6kjDajAA" target="_blank">this</a>

                            The Wavy Pavilion is a structure with an abstract form 
                            that can be subjectively interpreted as a leaf or a wave. 
                            The pavilion offers a sheltered space for visitors to relax 
                            or appreciate their surroundings, all while shielding them from 
                            the frequent rainfall of Metro Vancouver. Its design and translucent 
                            material correspond with the climate, 
                            enabling occupants to both experience and admire the rainfall.

                            While the pavilion's curved roof extends to cover most of the area from 
                            rainfall, there’s also room for walking and seating available to visitors.

                            The upper surface is made of light grey glass, which allows 
                            sunlight to filter through and illuminate the space containing 
                            the art sculpture and majority of the seating. In contrast, 
                            the base is created using dark grey glass, providing a clear 
                            distinction from the arched roof. There are also metal rods which 
                            reinforce the overhead surface and base, they are made of galvanized 
                            steel to prevent rusting in rainy conditions. To enhance the overall 
                            color coordination of each surface, the arched rods feature a lighter 
                            grey steel, while the base rods are a darker grey. Additionally, 
                            the bench shares the same shade as the arched rods positioned behind 
                            it, while the sculpture sits atop a glass pedestal 
                            that matches the color of the base. As for the art 
                            sculpture itself, we chose an aquamarine color with hues 
                            of blue and green to represent nearby water and shrubbery.

                            can freely navigate around the art sculpture, enjoying three meters

                            The Wavy Pavilion follows a clear axis of symmetry that is marked 
                            by a dip in the overhead surface, forming a focal 
                            point at the center of the structure which is especially apparent 
                            when a visitor approaches from the front entrance.<br>
                            This principle of symmetry is reinforced through the pavilion’s 
                            location within the park, as it is directly centered and aligns 
                            with a metal lotus sculpture closer to the middle of the park. <br><br>
                            There also exists a display of hierarchy  through the chosen colors 
                            and shapes, the rectangular aquamarine qualities of the sculpture 
                            starkly contrast with the monotone, curved, metallic tones 
                            throughout the rest of the pavilion.<br><br>
                            Repetition is another design principle demonstrated through 
                            the consistent use of repeating metal rods, providing an organized, 
                            uniform, and cohesive aesthetic throughout the entire structure.

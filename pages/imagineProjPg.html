                                 by a mobile application that offers

                                 I worked in a team of three,

                                 included the design and programming of the 
                                 mobile application, as well as coding Arduino to 
                                 Processing communication between the app

                            In order to properly understand the struggles that young adults with ASD face, we conducted 
                            thorough research on the topic, along with interviewing an individual with ASD. 
                            <br><br>
                            We found that possible concerns included:
                            <li>Anxiety</li>
                            <li>Low focus</li>

                        <p class="projInfoStyle" >
                            We interviewed Sersha, a 14 year old girl living with Asperger's in order to gain closer insight into our 
                            user group and pinpoint their central needs. 
                            We used an empathy map to acknowledge and illustrate her concerns. 
                            <br><br>

                            <br><br>
                            The main points we observed:
                            <li>Sound isolation, deep pressure therapy and mindfulness are extremely helpful.</li>
                            <li>Those with ASD are often overwhelmed and anxious.</li>
                            <li>Those with ASD don’t want to feel isolated and different.</li>
                            <br>
                        </p>

                        <p class="projInfoStyle" >
                            Deep pressure therapy helps to relax the nervous system and aids in minimizing sensory overload. We 
                            also noted that Sersha often feels overstimulated in loud environments, she likes to use her 
                            headphones to play music that eases these emotions
                            <br><br>
                            She also voiced her concerns about feeling like she stands out next to other kids or that she looks 
                            different. Therefore, my team and I aimed to create a product that would be subtle and comfortable.

                            the diagram below maps out both the user experience of our persona, and the three major pain points 
                            we identified.

                            The experience can be divided into using existing interventions (headphones and weighted vest) or nothing. 
                            <br><br>
                            The pain points are as follows: 
                            <li>Those with ASD almost always become distracted and anxious without interventions</li> 
                            <li>With interventions they are bullied</li>
                            <li>The most effective interventions are often too late in the experience</li>
                            <br><br><br><br>

                        <p class="projInfoStyle" >
                            In researching existing products designed with deep pressure therapy in mind, we came across an 
                            item called the Snug Vest by Linda Fraser. We compared its design against our goals and agreed that 
                            it did not appear very discrete and may result in the wearer feeling further ostracized from their 
                            peers. 
                            <br><br>
                            The Imagine Jacket takes inspiration from the Snug Vest’s efficient air pressure distribution, although 
                            it also addresses several other pain points present within the ASD community which sets it apart from 
                            many existing products.

                            We believed our solution should be based upon five important area’s of focus:
                            <li>Deep Pressure Therapy</li>
                            <li>Managing Anxiety</li>
                            <li>Discreet & Integrated Design</li>
                            <li>Temperature Flexibility</li>
                            <li>Soundscape Control</li>
                            <br><br>
                        </p>

                        <p class="projInfoStyle">
                            We began with the general concept of building a jacket with embedded technological enhancements. 
                            This article of clothing appears as an ordinary jacket, although it contains integrated features such as 
                            temperature control, different pressure settings, and the ability to pair with a mobile application. 
                            <br><br>
                            The app offers meditative soundscapes to help soothe the user, as well as different tabs which allow 
                            them to monitor how they are feeling.
                            <br><br>
                            These features are controlled through buttons and dials hidden within the jacket that are only 
                            accessible to the wearer and/or their caretaker. This ensures that they don’t feel ostracized and can 
                            self-sooth discretely.
                            <br><br>
                            On the backside there are button-controlled air pumps which circulate air between the front and back 
                            of the jacket. The air travels through a belt shaped area around the middle of the jacket so that 
                            pressure can be felt as a gentle squeeze. 
                            <br><br>
                            <img  id="myImg" src="../photos/airpumpIdeation.png" class="normalImg myImages"  alt="air circulation">
                            <br><br>
                            This pressure can be combined with temperature control to imitate a warm hug. Change in 
                            temperature is controlled through a potentiometer which is attached to heating pads that respond 
                            accordingly.
                            <br><br>

                            <br><br>
                            If the wearer begins to feel too warm however, the jacket offers a detachable hood and sleeves 
                            which are connected by Velcro for easy removal and attachment.
                            <br><br>

                            <br><br>
                            There is also a  galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor at the cuff of the sleeve that the user can wear 
                            around their fingers to observe their current emotional state. This would help them or their caretaker 
                            keep track of certain situational reactions, helping them to avoid or prepare a solution if that same 
                            event were to occur again
                            <br><br>
                            An additional playful touch is the fidget toy compartment, this is folded pocket on the side of the 
                            jacket secured by Velcro. When a user feels distracted, anxious, or overexcited while trying to 
                            complete a task they can unravel this pocket, unhook their favorite toy, and conveniently put 
                            everything back when they wish to do so.

                            The digital application for our jacket included many iterations, we considered a web application, 
                            mobile app, along with various methods of jacket control.
                            <br><br>
                            Initially we adapted to the concept of two-way control, where the jacket could be controlled both 
                            physically and digitally. However, during development we found that this extra step was slightly 
                            redundant, as the buttons on the jacket were the most accessible option and the repeated buttons 
                            would likely cause more confusion for the user. We concluded that a mobile app with the main 
                            purpose of monitoring was the most efficient mode of interaction.

                            Our adaptability helped us persevere through this project as we encountered many technical issues, 
                            along with a couple faulty components. Our initial idea of air pressure worked well in theory but fell 
                            flat when our air bags failed to hold the air properly. After testing alternative options such as balloons 
                            and a diy bag, we decided to make a brisk pivot to water pressure instead. This worked well for us, 
                            as the water provided a comforting weighted feel and did a great job at moving pressure between the 
                            two (back and front) pockets.

                            For our first cardboard prototype we used Ziplock bags to hold the fidget toys and water. Later on, we 
                            upgraded to IV bags and fabric pockets for a more sleek and secure feel.

                            The final composition of the jacket includes a stretchable fabric belt including water pockets situated 
                            on the front and back, secured by Velcro which offers adjustable waist sizing. The potentiometer dial 
                            and buttons are color matched to blend in with its exterior, while the fidget toy compartment is also 
                            hidden away within a foldable pocket

                            The Imagine Jacket is designed for versatility, flexibility, and a discreet experience. It prioritizes ease 
                            of use and quick interventions for young adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

                            The final app includes an straightforward interface, a tracking tab to track the wearers galvanic skin 
                            response status, a temperature tab to view the amount of heat being emitted from the heating pads, 
                            and lastly a music tab featuring meditative tracks to help ground the user when they are 
                            overwhelmed.

                            Sensor input from the jacket is read by Arduino and passed over to Processing through serial 
                            communication. This provides a constant stream of information, one byte at a time (with a baud rate 
                            of 9600), allowing the app to update and provide accurate results for the user to monitor.
